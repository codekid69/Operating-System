Compute -> contains cpu,gpu,disk,ethernet with card, main memory,usb all hardware devices

Apps-> used to perform some task

user-> user use the apps and they will get some work done

Operating System-> This os act as a manager between apps and  compute and distribute the resources bewtween apps || It make sure all the resources are available to the applications and none of the applications are consuming more resources than it needs, manage the resource.
Os does resource management, Also it provide simple interface to the applications to interact with the hardware.
Hides the hardware complexity

Summary 
An os is a peice of code (software and functions) that interfaces the applications and the hardware it also act as a resource manager and hides the hardware complexity
