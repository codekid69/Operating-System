Os Design Principles

1)policy -> A set of rules to get a job done

2) mechanism -> it is method to get policy fulfilled

Analogy of employee authentication

policy -> to get all the employee authenticated before entering the office
1 method -> card reader
2 method -> retina scan
these 2 are the mechanism

3 main element of Os

1) abstraction -> method the Os use to hide the complexity of underlining hardware

2) mechanism -> method that follow to fulfill abstraction using system calls like read , create, fork etc

3) policy -> plans that is considered when fulfilling an abstraction

Least recently used policy -> according to this which memeory page is least used that page is replaced with the new memory page



DESIGN PRINCIPLE FOR OS

1) mechanism and policy should be seprate
many application should support single mechanism and taht mechanism should supprt different policies

2) Common Used Cases -> user targeted , workload targeted, what type of apps work on this Os

3) OS should macro manage not micro manage -> means it should not take all descion by its own if it is then it should be resouce and time consuming
